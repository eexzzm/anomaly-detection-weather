The goal is a system that ingests recent weather observations and emits anomaly alerts

Detecting 'anomaly' or an extreme weather event. Detect atmospheric outliers:
- pressure drops beyond expected ranges
- wind speed spikes
- humidity temperature inconsistencies Focus: systems behavior, not outcome prediction. Significance: useful for early-warning-like design, even though you're not forecasting.
